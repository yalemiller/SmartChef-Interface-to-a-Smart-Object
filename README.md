# SmartChef-Interface-to-a-Smart-Object

## Getting Started:

Run "npm install" to install the following required packages
  -bootstrap
  -react-bootstrap
  -react-dom
  -react
  -vite


## Using the application:

SmartChef will load into the menu page which will be BLANK. This is normal and is because no appliances are selected from the drop down menu. Either choose a profile to select their appliances or choose from the list yourself

Only the air-fryer Broccoli and cheeseburger have the center button functionality.

Reloading the selection page or the cookingmode will cause the application to forget what recipe has been selected.
